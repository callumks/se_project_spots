# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project was made with HTML and CSS. Some of the techniques used are: Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries and CSS Variables. Techniques used such as responsive design, and basic HTML and CSS markup. Although difficult, it was a great exercise to improve my skills with CSS. To improve this project, I would like to add some animations and transitions, as well as additional pages.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
