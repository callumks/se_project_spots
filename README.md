# Project 3: Spots

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  

**Intro**
  
This project was made with HTML and CSS. Some of the techniques used are: Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries and CSS Variables. Although difficult, it was a great excercise to improve my skills with CSS. To improve this project, I would like to add some animations and transitions, as well as a additional pages.
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
